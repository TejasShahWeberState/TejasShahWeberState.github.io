                      Top 10 Favorite Video Game Characters
              </h3>
              <br><br>
              <p style="text-align: center">Video Games are my favorite hobby, so here are my top 10 favorite characters (from 10-1):
<!--                  As of right now, I only have 4 characters-->
  <OL reversed >
      <li >
          <h3 style="text-align: left">Luigi</h3>
          <img src="Pictures/Luigi.jpg" alt="Luigi" width="500" height="600" id='nondup'>
          <p style="text-align: center" class="char"> 
              Unlike most of the Nintendo characters, my first time playing as Luigi was not in a Smash Bros. series,
              but in Super Mario Bros. 2, on the NES. He was the best jumper in that game, even though I never beat
              that game. But every game that I have played that has Yoshi (outside of Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's
              Island), Luigi is in that game as well. In Super Smash Bros. 64, he had a fiery jump, and honestly,
              a lot better than Mario in that game. In other Super Smash games, he would use Green Missile 
              (headbutt and possibly fiery headbutt) for dangerous damage. In Mario Superstar Baseball, his high 
              jumping leads to magical jumping, and he is good/great everywhere in the game. <br><br>
              </p></li>
      
      <li>
          <h3 style="text-align: left">Captain Falcon</h3>
          <img src="Pictures/CaptainFalcon.jpg" alt="Captain Falcon" width="500" height="600" id='nondup'>
          <p style="text-align: center" class="char">
           This a character that I first knew threw Smash Bros. 64, and he is always one of a few characters I love
           to use in mnay Smash games. Shame that I have never played an F-Zero game (outside of demo of SNES 
           version), but even without playing those games, I have always had such fond memories playing as him
           in Smash because I would almost always use him when I was young (if I unlocked him). I always thought he
           said "Welcome! Punch!" when doing his iconic Falcon Punch. He learned some new moves in new Smash games,
           but his showoff "Show Me Your Moves" and his funny personality (especially in Super Smash Bros. Brawl)
           always has been special.<br><br>
           
           One of my favorites moments where you have to use him is in Smash Bros. Melee, event match 33, where
           Captain Falcon is on "steroids", and you have to reach the finish line, where time goes fast, and the
           cars, if they hit you, is pretty much you are dead. He is also hindered by horrible jumping, so
           sometimes his increased speed is not always the best thing. I am terrible at this event, but I still 
           enjoy it a lot.

          <h3 style="text-align: left">Carver</h3>
<!--          <img src="Pictures/Carver.jpg" alt="Carver" width="500" height="600" id='nondup'>-->
          <p style="text-align: center" class="char">
          Dragon Quest 6 is not my favorite Dragon Quest game, but one of the characters I really enjoyed in this
          game was Carver, easily.
          </p></li>
      
      <li>
      <li>
          <h3 style="text-align: left">Ness</h3>
          <img src="Pictures/Ness.jpg" alt="Ness" width="500" height="600" id='nondup'>
          <p style="text-align: center" class="char">
          Another character where I first played or known him from Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64. However,
          he is one of my main in Super Smash Bros. 64, Melee, and Wii U. I find his movesets to be interesting
          because he never learns PSI Fire (he calls it PK instead of PSI) or Thunder in Earthbound. It took me
          playing Earthbound and learning more about the game to understand why he learns those moves (though I
          still to this day don't understand why he learns Starstorm instead of Rockin). <br><br>
          
          However, Ness is an interesting silent protagonist, and the adventure he goes through in Earthbound is 
          something I love the game even more the more times I play it. Everytime I start a new game of Earthbound,
          I feel like Ness gets a new character trait that I never witnessed the last time I play it. Seriously, 
          don't play Earthbound for the gameplay (I think it is fine) or story. Play it for the adventure, 
          the music, the traits, etc.!
          </p></li>
      
      <li>
          <h3 style="text-align: left">Yoshi</h3>
          <img src="Pictures/Yoshi.jpg" alt="Yoshi" width="500" height="600" id='nondup'>
          <p style="text-align: center" class="char">
          Is there anything I can say about my favorite Nintendo character? The first time I remember
          playing as Yoshi was on Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64, like most of my favorite 
          Nintendo characters. While he might not be the best fighter, this green dinosaur ends up being
          the character I use a lot in sports games, sometimes even bonus events in the Smash Bros. games. 
          Also Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island is a brilliant game and one of the few non-JRPG or sports 
          game that I have beaten. He also, in my opinion, is the best player in Mario SuperStar Baseball 
          because of his speed and his tongue-catching, which makes up for his not so great pitching and 
          fielding. Whenever I needed someone to step up in the clutch, Yoshi has always been their for me.<br><br>
