              <p>Video Games are my favorite hobby, so here are my top 10 favorite (from 10-1):
<!--                  As of right now, I only have 4 characters-->
  <OL id="proj" reversed>
      <li>
          <h2 style="text-align: center">Captain Falcon</h2>
          <img src="Pictures/CaptainFalcon.jpg" alt="Captain Falcon" width="500" height="600" id='nondup'></li>
      <li>
          <h2 style="text-align: center">Luigi</h2>
          <img src="Pictures/Luigi.jpg" alt="Luigi" width="500" height="600" id='nondup'></li>
      <li>
          <h2 style="text-align: center">Ness</h2>
          <img src="Pictures/Ness.jpg" alt="Ness" width="500" height="600" id='nondup'>
          <p style="text-align: center">
          Another character where I first played or known him from Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64. However,
          he is one of my main in Super Smash Bros. 64, Melee, and Wii U. I find his movesets to be interesting
          because he never learns PSI Fire (he calls it PK instead of PSI) or Thunder in Earthbound. It took me
          playing Earthbound and learning more about the game to understand why he learns those moves (though I
          still to this day don't understand why he learns Starstorm instead of Rockin). <br><br>
          
          However, Ness is an interesting silent protagonist, and the adventure he goes through in Earthbound is 
          something I love the game even more the more times I play it. Everytime I start a new game of Earthbound,
          I feel like Ness gets a new character trait that I never witnessed the last time I play it. Seriously, 
          don't play Earthbound for the gameplay (I think it is fine) or story. Play it for the adventure, 
          the music, the traits, etc.!
          </p></li>
      <li>
          <h2 style="text-align: center">Yoshi</h2>
          <img src="Pictures/Yoshi.jpg" alt="Yoshi" width="500" height="600" id='nondup'>
          <p style="text-align: center">
          Is there anything I can say about my favorite Nintendo character? The first time I remember
          playing as Yoshi was on Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64, like most of my favorite 
          Nintendo characters. While he might not be the best fighter, this green dinosaur ends up being
          the character I use a lot in sports games, sometimes even bonus events in the Smash Bros. games. 
          Also Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island is a brilliant game and one of the few non-JRPG or sports 
          game that I have beaten. He also, in my opinion, is the best player in Mario SuperStar Baseball 
          because of his speed and his tongue-catching, which makes up for his not so great pitching and 
          fielding. Whenever I needed someone to step up in the clutch, Yoshi has always been their for me.<br><br>
          
          Yoshi has always proven to not only be loyal to Mario, but when times comes, he will do whatever it
          takes to help Mario accomplish his goals.
