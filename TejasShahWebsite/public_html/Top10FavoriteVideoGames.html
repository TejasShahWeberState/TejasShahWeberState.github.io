          <h3 style="text-align: left">Dragon Warrior/Quest 4 (NES/DS)</h3>
          <p style="text-align: center" class="char"> 
             Just like Dragon Warrior 5 and 6, I started playing this game (both the NES and DS) in 2018. This game
             was the first game in the series to have a chapter system, and today, I am still marveled by how they
             were able to fit the chapter system on the NES. It builds off Dragon Warrior 3 that you can have the
             main character be a female, but it also improves that you can name your character more than 4 letters
             long. <br><br>
             
             
             Name changes: NES(Brey, Cristo, Mara, Nara)to DS(Borya, Kiryl, Maya, and Meena). 
                          
           </p></li>    
      <li>
          <h3 style="text-align: left">Dragon Warrior/Quest 3 (GBC)</h3>
          <p style="text-align: center" class="char"> 
              I only started playing this game in 2018, and I have only beaten the game once (not 100%, that will 
              take a long time). This game is very long, you will have to grind, and to 100% this game, you have to
              monster hunt and treasure hunt, but at the end, it is all worth it.<br><br>
              
              I like Dragon Warrior 2 (both the NES and GBC), but Dragon Warrior 3, outside of music, completely
              outclasses it so much that I have never seen a game improve so much from its predecessor. Already,
              before you even start the game, you seen an improvement that you can have your main character be
              a female. Next, you have a personality test to determine your personality. And one of the biggest
              improvements over Dragon Warrior 2 is the bag feature, as before, you had to deposit items or sell
              them, in order to free up space. But in this game, unless you want to sell them, you don't need to.
              Selling is not necessary because getting money will not be difficult in this game. <br><br>
              
              As if this game didn't improve more than enough, it introduced a class system, so there are now even
              more classes: Warrior, Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Thief, Dealer, and Jester. You get another class, Sage,
              later, but unless you are a Jester, you have to get an item to become a Sage (Main cannot be Sage).
              Each of those classes has strengths and weaknesses, and in cases of Thief, Jesters, and Dealers, they
              all have special abilities. Thieves can steal items after battles and can search area for treasures, 
              Dealers can appraise items (see who can equip which equipment and check if they are cursed), and while
              Jesters are terrible fighters, they can cast Whistle to make grinding easier, and they can turn into
              Sage easier than other classes.<br><br>
              
              Even though I have mentioned these improvements, I have yet to mention the 5 main improvements from 2.
              First off, the day/night system. At daytime, you can adventure more easily, because items and equipment
              stores are more likely open during the day, and enemies are more common at night. But nighttime has
              some benefits too, like if you want to grind, you will find more enemies at night, but also because
              most characters will sleep at night, you can look into areas that you couldn't during the day, and
              you can find items and other events. Plus the music changes during the night when you are in town or
              castle.<br><br>
              
              Then there are some towns and even castles in the game where you feel eerily when you first visit
              the place, but after you finish some events, the place will be completely different and the dialogue
              of some characters changes.<br><br>
              
              Third the map of the world looks like the real world, but on opposite side (like South America is on
              the right instead of left). Places like Jipang and Romaly are based off real-life countries (though
              unfortunately, Isis is a name of a castle, and if the game was made today, that would not go well).<br><br>
              
              
              
              But the thing that really got to me the first time I played this game, was battling in this game. When
              I first played this game, my first battle was 4 Slimes, really easy enemies. I just hit attack for all
              of them because the 4 Slimes were all in a same category (very important in this game). But the best 
              part, which made me love this game from the start, is when one of the Slimes attacked, you got to see
              an animation of the Slime doing the attack. I was shocked to see that, and I was very impressed. After
              you defeat an enemy, you have a chance to earn monster medals, and if you want to 100% this game, you
              will have to get monster medals, which means this game does have extra features outside of beating
              the game.<br><br>
              
              Let me say it this way, while I liked 1 and 2, 3 saved this awesome Franchise.
